To perform this evaluation, it is necessary to run the algorithm against a set of sample data.\n\nCurrently on the `p3.2xlarge` instance, it takes approximately 20 minutes to evaluate one page of the sample data (one content item) using the algorithm. By switching the instance type to `p3.8xlarge`, we roughly estimate that this time can be brought down to 5 minutes per page of the sample data.\n\nBy speeding up the evaluation process, we will be able to determine the suitability of the algorithm for the purpose of generating related links and will then productionise the process to be able to evaluate ~200K content items for the actual A/B test.\n\nIn terms of cost (at the time of writing), the `p3.8xlarge` is priced at $12.24/hr; we anticipate that we will need up to 8 hours of compute time, which would result in a total cost of $97.92. In comparison, the `p3.2xlarge` currently costs $3.06/hr - this would result in the same total cost of $97.92 as we anticipate it would take up to four times as long to completely evaluate our sample data.",

    "content": "Add NAT instances to ecs module\n\nThe ecs module creates NAT gateways for the ECS hosts to use for\negressing out to the internet. However, NAT gateways are rediculously\nexpensive. The solution is to use NAT instances instead, which are EC2\ninstances configured to act as NAT boxes. Because they are just EC2\ninstances we can use spot pricing to massively reduce the cost.\n\nTo be resilient we need a NAT instance in each availability zone. To\nensure this is the case we need an ASG in each AZ which maintains\nexactly one spot instance. We also create an ENI for each NAT instance,\nwhich will persist as spot instances come and go and provide a static ID\nwhich can be used in routing tables.",
