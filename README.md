  ```

## Codes

Each entry (i.e. commits) in `dataset.json` is tagged with one or more of 14 codes identified during the study execution. The definition of each code is presented below.

- **alert**: denotes messages expressing concerns related to billing alarms enforcing an upper threshold on costs.
- **area**: denotes messages expressing concerns related to server or instance geographical location.
- **awareness**: denotes messages simply mentioning concerns with cost (without necessarily implying action).
- **billing_mode**: denotes messages expressing concerns related to the type of billing plan being used (e.g., on-demand for development or normal plan for production).
- **cluster**: denotes messages expressing concerns related to cluster configuration.
- **domain**: denotes messages expressing concerns related to domain name system and IP addresses.
- **feature**: denotes messages expressing concerns related to various features such as logging, load balancers or usage of third party libraries.
- **increase**: denotes messages expressing concerns related to increase in cost due to a change.
- **instance**: denotes messages expressing concerns related to computational instances (e.g., Amazon AWS t2.micro) used in the deployment.
- **networking**: denotes messages expressing concerns related to networking configuration.
- **policy**: denotes messages expressing concerns related to the implementation of general rules to prevent excessive charges.
- **provider**: denotes messages expressing concerns related to choosing a service providers (e.g., Amazon, Azure, Google)
- **saving**: denotes mentioned changes made to save costs.
- **storage**: denotes messages expressing concerns related to storage solutions (e.g., Amazon gp2) used in the deployment.
